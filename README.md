# 🛠️ Python Error Handling Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates robust Python programming practices through a series of examples focused on **error handling**. The code explores how to manage exceptions gracefully, ensuring that applications remain stable and user-friendly even when unexpected inputs or operations occur.

---

## 💡 Key Highlights

- Implementation of `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks
- Use of multiple `except` clauses to handle specific exception types
- Demonstration of raising custom exceptions for user-defined logic
- Input validation and feedback mechanisms to prevent runtime crashes
- Examples designed to mimic real-world scenarios where error handling is critical
